# Arithmetic operators
a = 5
b = 2

print(a+b)  # addition of the a and b
print(a-b)  # subtraction of the a and b
print(a*b)  # multiplication of a and b
print(a/b)  # division operation between a and b
print(a//b)  # how much b can be set in a = how much times can 2 be set in 5, 2x2 = 4 + 1 = 5
print(a % b)  # 5/2=4 reminder is 1 - % calculates reminder
print(a**b)  # 5 ** 2 = 5 * 5 = 25 - powered by, like square


### Relational Operators ###

# > < >= <= != ==
# relational operators always returning True/False - boolean value

a = 5
b = 10

print(a > b)  # False
print(a < b)  # True
print(a == b)  # False
print(a >= b)  # False
print(a <= b)  # True
print(a != b)  # True


### Logical Operators ### - always working with boolean type, result is always boolean either True/False
# Three operators: and / or / not

b1 = True
b2 = False

print(b1 and b2)  # if both var are True will be True
print(b1 or b2)  # if one of the var True then True
print(not b1, not b2)  # negative from the var - if True then False and vice versa
